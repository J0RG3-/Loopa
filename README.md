## LOOPA App

Loopa is a user-friendly mobile app designed to simplify recycling in Chile. It helps users identify recyclable waste by scanning items, locate nearby recycling points, and track their recycling activities. Loopa also provides educational tips and incentives to encourage sustainable habits and make recycling easier and more rewarding for everyone.

## 1. Introduction

In **Chile**, more than **17 million tons of solid waste** are generated each year, with approximately **7 million tons** classified as household waste. However, less than **10%** of this is recycled, despite national policies such as the **Extended Producer Responsibility Law (Ley REP)** and other environmental initiatives ([Chile.gob.cl, 2023](https://www.chile.gob.cl/chile/blog/todos/nueva-ley-de-reciclaje-chile-avanza-en-sus-compromisos-medioambientales)).

This low recycling rate is not solely due to a lack of infrastructure, but also stems from several informational and motivational barriers:

- Lack of clear information on proper waste classification.
- Limited knowledge about where to find nearby recycling points and their availability.
- Low motivation due to the absence of personal benefits or incentives.
- Confusion arising from diverse material types and the lack of standardization in recycling processes.

## 2. Problem Statement

The problem addressed by this project is the **low recycling engagement among individuals due to informational and motivational gaps**. There is a clear need for an accessible, user-friendly tool that enables people to:

- Identify recyclable waste through barcode scanning or manual search.
- Locate and navigate to nearby recycling points, filtered by material type and availability.
- Track and register their recycling actions.
- Receive feedback and incentives to encourage ongoing participation.
- Learn from reliable content on proper recycling practices.

The proposed solution is a **mobile application** aimed at facilitating the recycling process for everyday users, helping them overcome these common barriers while promoting sustainable behaviors through education and engagement.

## 4. Benchmark

We analyzed four recycling apps from Latin America—Reciclapp (Chile), VerdeClick, Literatti (global), and ReciApp (Ecuador)—to identify strengths and weaknesses relevant to our project.

Overall, while these apps demonstrate valuable features individually—such as education, community engagement, scanning, and rewards—none fully integrates all these elements with a focus on the Chilean context. Our app intends to fill this gap by combining these functionalities into a seamless and localized solution that promotes sustainable recycling habits effectively.

## 5. UX Personas

To better understand the needs, motivations, and behaviors of our target users, we have developed three distinct UX personas. These personas represent typical users who will interact with our recycling app, allowing us to tailor the design and functionality to meet their specific requirements. By focusing on these user archetypes, we aim to create a more user-centered experience that encourages effective recycling habits and sustained engagement.

## 6. Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas helps us clearly define the relationship between our users’ needs and the solutions our app provides. By mapping out user jobs, pains, and gains alongside our product’s features and benefits, we ensure that our solution effectively addresses real problems and creates meaningful value for users.

## 7. Customer Journey Map

The Customer Journey Map visualizes the step-by-step experience of a user interacting with our app. It highlights the user’s goals, actions, emotions, pain points, and touchpoints throughout their journey. This helps us understand user behavior, identify opportunities for improvement, and design a smoother, more satisfying experience tailored to their needs.

## 8. Low-Fidelity Proposal (Initial Mockups)
Below are the initial low-fidelity mockups that outline the basic structure and user flow of the application. These sketches emphasize functionality and navigation without focusing on visual details, allowing us to quickly identify usability issues and gather feedback early in the design process.
